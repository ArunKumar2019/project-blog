Here are some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with answers on Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) in Microservices:

Basic Concepts of Event-Driven Architecture

1. What is an event in an event-driven architecture?
a) A function call between microservices
b) A state change in the system
c) A request-response interaction
d) A REST API call

Answer: b) A state change in the system


2. Which of the following best describes event-driven architecture?
a) A system where components communicate by sharing a database
b) A system where components communicate via direct API calls
c) A system where components produce and consume events asynchronously
d) A system that only works with monolithic applications

Answer: c) A system where components produce and consume events asynchronously


3. Which messaging patterns are commonly used in event-driven microservices?
a) Request-response
b) Publish-subscribe
c) Point-to-point
d) Both b and c

Answer: d) Both b and c



Event Brokers and Messaging Systems

4. Which of the following tools can be used as an event broker in microservices?
a) Apache Kafka
b) RabbitMQ
c) AWS SNS/SQS
d) All of the above

Answer: d) All of the above


5. In event-driven microservices, what is the role of a message broker?
a) To store data persistently
b) To facilitate communication between services by routing events
c) To replace databases in microservices
d) To execute business logic

Answer: b) To facilitate communication between services by routing events



Event Types and Processing

6. Which of the following best describes a "domain event"?
a) A user-generated HTTP request
b) A significant state change in a business domain
c) A scheduled cron job execution
d) A response from an API

Answer: b) A significant state change in a business domain


7. Which event pattern ensures that the event publisher does not need to know about the event subscribers?
a) Request-response
b) Synchronous API calls
c) Event sourcing
d) Publish-subscribe

Answer: d) Publish-subscribe


8. What is event sourcing in event-driven architecture?
a) A way to fetch data from multiple sources
b) A pattern where state changes are stored as a sequence of events
c) A method to optimize database queries
d) A way to call REST APIs asynchronously

Answer: b) A pattern where state changes are stored as a sequence of events



Benefits and Challenges of EDA

9. What is a key benefit of using an event-driven architecture in microservices?
a) Reduced latency in API calls
b) Improved scalability and decoupling of services
c) Simplified debugging and logging
d) Strong dependency between services

Answer: b) Improved scalability and decoupling of services


10. What is one major challenge of implementing event-driven architecture?
a) Increased performance overhead due to direct API calls
b) Tight coupling between microservices
c) Eventual consistency and debugging complexity
d) Reduced system reliability

Answer: c) Eventual consistency and debugging complexity
